# Implementation of Algorithms

It's always been hard for me to implement the algorithms learnt in class to implement them in R. So, this repository is primarily works as the place for me to implement the algorithms/statistical methods/paper to improve my coding skills. 

Through homework and personal purpose, I have implemented the Jacobi (both paralleled and sequential)/Gauss-Seidel, Leveraging, and Elastic Net(This is a tough one, which took me more than 20 hours to spot my typo) in R.(To be added.)

Please feel free to correct me if there is anything I may improve.
